# Namprojects

In this project, I learnt react by building a large project following up an experienced developoer's footsteps. I have realised this ios one of the fastest way for me to learn based on my recent education. Morever, since I also have a lot to learn in a short period. a learning curve from tough/large to medium and small is the best way to achieve my goals within the shortest possible period. I welcome you to this ride.
