# Namprojects

In this project, I learnt react by building a large project following up an experienced developoer's footsteps. I have realised this ios one of the fastest way for me to learn based on my recent education. Morever, since I also have a lot to learn in a short period. a learning curve from tough/large to medium and small is the best way to achieve my goals within the shortest possible period. I welcome you to this ride.

DAY 1 and 2:

Learning about starting react app and npm:
--- npm init
--- npm Dev and Normal Dependencies
--- krep and tilde
--- transitive dependencies: Parcel the beast and others
--- Node modules
-- npm: Node modules
-- npx: parcel execution

---Component composition: Nesting components inside one another
